In version 1.8 Minecraft added the "Alternate Blocks" setting which, when toggled on, gave certain blocks a random orientation. In Minecraft 1.9 removed the option, making certain blocks always have a random orientation.

Thanks to resource packs, the previous non-random state for those blocks can be restored. Because this doesn't touch the textures directly, this is compatible with any resource pack that doesn't modify the block states.

If you're playing on a server and take screenshots, but have people decode the random block rotations to find and grief your build, this pack will hinder their ability to find your build. Note: this won't prevent users from decoding based on blocks this pack does NOT unrandomize (such as Lily Pads) nor natural features in the screenshot (such as where flowers spawn).

Pack version numbers coincide with format numbers for ease of tracking. Snapshots are not directly supported (in some cases, version numbers will skip to keep in line with format numbers). In most cases, you can use an existing pack with a different version. In my experience, Minecraft tends to deselect your resource packs that are out of date, but there are rarely changes that break using an older version with whichever version you are playing. Check the changelog for (known) breaking changes.
